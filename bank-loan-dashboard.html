									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Dashboard. This Dashboard aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. It will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

									<h3>Dashboard 2: Overview</h3>
									<p>In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters.</p>
									<b>Chart Requirements:</b>
									<p>1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart) <br>
										2. Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map) <br>
										3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart) <br>
										4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart) <br>
										5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart) <br>
										6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map) <br>
										</p>
									
									<h2>Key Findings </h2>
									<ol>
										<li> <b> Positive Growth Trends:-</b> There is a consistent month-over-month increase in key metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).The rise in the percentage of "Good Loans" (Current and Fully Paid) indicates a healthy loan portfolio.</li>
										<li><b>Portfolio Health:-</b> Most of the 32.1k loan applications fall under the category of Fully Paid, reflecting a positive repayment trend. The number of Current Loans (1.1k) is notably smaller than Fully Paid Loans, suggesting a need to focus on increasing the proportion of current loans.</li>
										<li><b>Charged Loans Analysis:-</b> Charged Loans amount to 5.3k, indicating a segment that needs attention. While the Average Interest Rate on Current Loans is 15.1%, Charged Loans have a slightly lower rate of 13.9%.</li>
										<li><b>Debt-to-Income Ratio Insights: -</b> The Average Debt-to-Income Ratio is 14.7%, suggesting borrowers generally have a healthy balance between debt and income. Notably, the Charged Off Loans have a similar average ratio of 14%, implying a need for closer scrutiny in evaluating borrower financial health.</li>
										<li><b> Purpose and Home Ownership Influence: -</b> Debt Consolidation is the highest loan purpose (18.2k), indicating a common financial goal among borrowers.Mortgage and Rent categories contribute significantly to the home ownership profile (17.2k), highlighting a need to tailor loan offerings to these segments.</li>
										<li><b>Loan Term Distribution:- </b>The majority of loans have a term of 36 months (73%), with 27% having a 60-month term. This suggests a preference for shorter-term commitments, aligning with a potential strategy for more flexible loan terms.</li>
									</ol>

									<h2>Recommendations</h2>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Optimize Current Loans:- </b>Implement strategies to increase the number of current loans, providing incentives for timely payments and customer engagement.
										</li>
										<li><b> Risk Management for Charged Loans:-</b> Conduct a thorough risk assessment of Charged Loans to understand the factors contributing to charge-offs. Consider targeted interventions, such as revised interest rates or personalized financial counseling, to mitigate risk in this segment.
										</li>
										<li><b>Debt Consolidation Specialization:-</b> Given the popularity of debt consolidation, tailor marketing efforts and loan products to cater specifically to borrowers seeking debt consolidation.</li>
										<li><b>Home Ownership-Centric Approach:-</b> Customize loan offerings based on the prevalent home ownership profiles (e.g., Mortgage and Rent), aligning with the financial needs and capabilities of these segments.
										</li>
										<li><b>Flexibility in Loan Terms:-</b> Acknowledge the preference for shorter-term commitments and explore options for flexible loan terms to attract a wider customer base.
										</li>
										<li><b>Continuous Monitoring and Analysis: -</b> Establish regular monitoring mechanisms to track changes in key metrics, enabling proactive decision-making and adapting strategies based on evolving trends.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>These recommendations aim to enhance portfolio health, mitigate risks, and align lending strategies with the evolving preferences and needs of borrowers.
